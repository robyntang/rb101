# 05_staggered_caps_01.rb

# Write a method that takes a String as an argument,
# and returns a new String that contains the original
# value using a staggered capitalization scheme in
# which every other character is capitalized, 
# and the remaining characters are lowercase.
# Characters that are not letters should not be changed,
# but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.
